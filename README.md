## Introduction

This project provides the implementation of several C library functions like `malloc`, `free`, `strdup`, `memcpy`, and more. 
It also serves as an excellent opportunity to develop low-level programming skills and deep knowledge of how the C standard library operates.

## Functions Implemented

- `ft_strlen()`
- `ft_strdup()`
- `ft_memcpy()`
- `ft_memset()`
- `ft_strchr()`
- `ft_strcmp()`
- `ft_calloc()`
- (and moreâ€¦)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ael-ayoub/libft.git
    ```

2. Compile the functions:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. To test the functions, run:
    ```bash
    make all
    ```
